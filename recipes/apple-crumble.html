        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>575g apples</li>
            <li>130g sugar</li>
            <li>175g plain flour</li>
            <li>110g cold butter</li>
            <li>1 tbsp oats</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 190C/170 fan</li>
            <li>Toss the peeled, cored, sliced aples with 2 tbsp sugar as well as the cinnamon and put in a 23cm round baking dish at least 5 cm deep. Flatten with your hand to prevent too much crumble falling through.</li>
            <li>Put flour and 110g sugar in a bowl with a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Add 110g butter and rub it in with your fingertips until mixture looks like moist breadcrumbs or until no big bits come to the surface when you shake the bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour crumble mix over the apples and use fork to even out.</li>
            <li>Gently pres the surface with the back of the fork so the crumble holds together and goes crisp.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle 1 tbsp oats and 1 tbsp sugar over evenly.</li>
            <li>Set on a baking tray and put in the oven for 35-40 minutes, until the top is golden and the apples feel soft when you insert a small, sharp knife. Leave to cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
