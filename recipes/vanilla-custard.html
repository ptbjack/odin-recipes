        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>After a long search looking for a perfect recipe for vanilla custard, our good old neighborhood food activist Jamie Oliver runs to the rescue. This custard is supposed to be smooth, not too solid nor too runny.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500ml milk</li>
            <li>500ml cream</li>
            <li>1 pack of vanilla</li>
            <li>8 egg yolks</li>
            <li>5 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tea spoon cornflour</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a pan on medium-high heat</li>
            <li>Pour milk and cream in and bring up to heat.</li>
            <li>Add vanilla, bring up to simmer and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, add sugar to egg yolks and whisk.</li>
            <li>Add cornflour to the bowl, continue whisking until no lump.</li>
            <li>Take a splash of milk into the eggs, whisk it in and add the mixture to the milk pan.</li>
            <li>Whisk the mixture on heat with "8" movement until it doesn't run on the back of the spoon.</li>
        </ol>
